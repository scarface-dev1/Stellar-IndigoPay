## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Node.js | ≥ 18.x |
| npm | Latest |
| Rust + Cargo | ≥ 1.74 (for contracts) |
| Freighter Wallet | Browser extension |

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/stellar-indigopay.git
cd stellar-indigopay
chmod +x scripts/setup-dev.sh
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

### 2. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:4000
```

### Docker Hot-Reload Development

Use the development override when you want frontend and backend source edits to refresh inside Docker without rebuilding:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

The override mounts `backend/src` directly into the API container and runs Nodemon in legacy watch mode for Docker Desktop file-event reliability. It mounts the frontend workspace into the Next.js container, keeps container-owned `node_modules`/`.next` directories, and enables polling for Next/Webpack watchers.

### Secret Scanning

Every push and every pull request to `main` runs Gitleaks with the repo-local `.gitleaks.toml` config. Any detected secret fails CI, so keep real credentials out of source control; use `.env` files locally and GitHub encrypted secrets for CI/deployment values. The allowlist only covers generated archives, env templates, and deterministic test fixtures.
