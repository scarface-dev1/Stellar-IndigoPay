## Submission Steps

1. **Create Developer Account**
   - Visit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions
   - Click 'Publish extensions'
   - Complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification

2. **Upload Extension**
   - Use Chrome Web Store Developer Console
   - Upload `indigopay-extension.zip` from `extension/` directory
   - Ensure `manifest.json` includes all required permissions

3. **Add Store Assets**
   - Upload 128x128 icon
   - Upload 440x280 promotional tile
   - Upload 1280x800 screenshot
   - Complete store listing text

4. **Set Permissions**
   - Justify `<all_urls>` host permission:
     "The extension injects a content script to detect Stellar addresses (format: GXXXXXXX) on any webpage and offer users the ability to donate to those addresses via our platform."

5. **Submit for Review**
   - Review all policy requirements
   - Submit for automatic and manual review
   - Chrome Web Store team reviews within 24-72 hours

## Review Policy Compliance

- No malware or unsafe behavior
- No content scripts that modify user experience without consent (our tooltip is an opt-in donation feature)
- Clear privacy policy linked in manifest
- No data collection beyond user donations

## Firefox Add-ons (Future)

For Firefox support, use `manifest.firefox.json` and submit to:
https://addons.mozilla.org/

Similar process, but additional developer verification required.

## Troubleshooting

- **Upload fails**: Verify `manifest.json` is valid JSON with all required fields
- **Store listing rejected**: Check policy compliance, particularly around permissions justification
- **Assets rejected**: Ensure correct dimensions (128x128, 440x280, 1280x800) and PNG format

## Versioning

When updating the extension:
1. Increment version in `manifest.json` and `manifest.firefox.json`
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate `dist/`
3. Create `indigopay-extension-v1.x.x.zip` for release
4. Submit new version through Chrome Web Store Developer Console
